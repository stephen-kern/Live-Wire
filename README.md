## Description

- This application is a social media platform where people can review their thoughts and experiences while attending a concert or listening to their favorite album. We built this application to exercise our knowledge of ReactJs while framing it in something else we love, music. Live Wire is a MERN stack application that uses GraphQl, MongoDb and React.

## USER STORY

- As a music lover
- I WANT an app to share my thoughts on artists I enjoy, shows i've attended, or genres in general.
- SO THAT i can engage with others online and find new cool stuff to listen to.
